description: ESPHome documentation-first workflow for ESPHome-specific questions, YAML/config authoring, component selection, substitutions/packages usage, device definitions, secrets handling, OTA/update planning, build/compile troubleshooting, sensor/actuator tuning, logs, diagnostics, and live ESPHome dashboard or node maintenance. Use whenever ESPHome, esphome, ESP32, ESP8266, YAML device configs, dashboards, packages, substitutions, secrets.yaml, entities defined in ESPHome, OTA flashing, compile errors, component options, pin assignments, Wi-Fi provisioning, or ESPHome node troubleshooting is mentioned, implied, or required. Also use before answering direct or indirect ESPHome questions and before performing direct ESPHome configuration or operational work.

# ESPHome Encyclopedia

## Overview

Use a docs-first workflow for ESPHome work. Prefer the official ESPHome documentation at `https://esphome.io/`, consult cached local copies under `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/` before re-fetching, and record useful official-doc excerpts plus environment-specific operational learnings so future work gets faster and safer.

## Workflow

1. **Classify the task**
   - Decide whether the task is an ESPHome question, YAML authoring task, config review, component-selection task, troubleshooting task, or live dashboard/node task.
   - If the task materially depends on ESPHome syntax, component semantics, supported options, build/runtime behavior, or node operations, use this skill.

2. **Check local cache first**
   - Use `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/` as the local knowledge/cache root.
   - Check these locations first when relevant:
     - `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/docs/esphome.io/...`
     - `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/devices/...`
     - `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/components/...`
     - `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/patterns/...`
     - `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/inventory/...`
   - If a cached page or note already answers the question well enough, use it.

3. **Consult official ESPHome docs before answering or touching configs/nodes**
   - Before answering direct or indirect ESPHome questions that depend on YAML syntax, component behavior, version-sensitive options, dashboard behavior, OTA/update expectations, or pin/component constraints, consult the official docs unless the answer is already well-supported by the local cache.
   - Before performing direct ESPHome configuration or dashboard/node work, consult the relevant docs first when:
     - exact option names or nesting matter
     - component behavior is easy to misremember
     - the action could affect device availability, flashing, Wi-Fi reachability, sensors, relays, pins, or OTA updates
   - Do not improvise fragile ESPHome YAML from memory when the docs are easy to check.

4. **Cache consulted docs locally**
   - When you consult an ESPHome docs page, save a normalized cache copy under `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/docs/esphome.io/...`.
   - Mirror the official path structure as much as practical.
   - Cache only pages actually consulted; do not try to mirror the whole docs site eagerly.
   - Use `scripts/cache_doc.py` when appropriate.

5. **Separate official documentation from local observations**
   - Store official-doc-derived material under `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/docs/...`.
   - Store environment-specific operational knowledge under:
     - `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/devices/`
     - `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/components/`
     - `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/patterns/`
     - `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/inventory/`
   - Distinguish clearly between:
     - official documented behavior
     - observed local configuration/state
     - inferred best-practice guidance

6. **Record useful local learnings**
   - After useful live work, save durable notes such as:
     - device names and roles
     - dashboard access paths
     - repeated YAML patterns
     - board/framework gotchas
     - pin mappings and hardware quirks
     - OTA/build trouble patterns
     - safe/unsafe operational boundaries for the environment
   - Prefer concise durable notes over re-learning the same ESPHome details later.

## Live Work Rules

- Treat official docs lookup as the default preflight for non-trivial ESPHome work.
- Prefer read/inspect first when entering an ESPHome dashboard, config set, or node you have not recently reviewed.
- Treat pin changes, framework changes, package/substitution refactors, OTA/update actions, and anything that could make a node unreachable as higher-sensitivity areas.
- When uncertainty remains after checking cache + docs, say so and avoid bluffing.
- When answering a question, mention when useful whether the answer comes from cached official docs, a fresh official docs lookup, or live observed environment state.

## Data Root

Use this workspace-local root for cache and notes:

- `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/`

Expected structure:

- `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/docs/esphome.io/...`
- `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/devices/...`
- `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/components/...`
- `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/patterns/...`
- `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/inventory/...`

Use `scripts/init_workspace.py` to create or repair the expected directory structure.

## Note Destinations

- Device-specific observations → `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/devices/<device-name>.md`
- Component-specific observations → `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/components/<component-name>.md`
- Reusable ESPHome patterns/gotchas → `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/notes/patterns/<topic>.md`
- Environment-wide dashboard/access inventories → `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/inventory/*.md`
- Cached official docs → `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/docs/esphome.io/...`

## Resources

- `scripts/init_workspace.py` — create or repair the `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/` directory tree.
- `scripts/cache_doc.py` — fetch and cache an official ESPHome docs page under `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/docs/...`.
- `references/workflow.md` — detailed operating workflow and evidence-handling rules.
- `references/cache-layout.md` — canonical `.ESPHome-Encyclopedia/` directory structure.
- `references/topic-map.md` — useful ESPHome topic groupings for faster official-doc lookup.

## Good Outcomes

- Answer an ESPHome question using cached or freshly checked official docs instead of guesswork.
- Inspect a live ESPHome dashboard/config set after checking the relevant docs and record any new local device/config knowledge.
- Build a growing local ESPHome knowledge cache that makes later work faster, safer, and more grounded.
- Turn one-off ESPHome discoveries into durable notes so future work does not rediscover them from scratch.

## Avoid

- Answering ESPHome-specific questions purely from memory when docs are easy to consult.
- Treating local observed node behavior as if it were guaranteed official documented behavior.
- Dumping large amounts of low-value docs into the workspace without a reason.
- Writing device-specific observations into the official-doc cache tree.
- Making device-impacting config or OTA changes before checking the relevant docs when exact behavior matters.
